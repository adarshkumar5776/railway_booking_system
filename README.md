# Train Booking System API

This is a RESTful API for a train booking system. It provides endpoints for user registration, login, booking seats on trains, fetching seat availability, and getting booking details. The API is built using Django and Django Rest Framework.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```python
https://github.com/adarshkumar5776/railway_booking_system
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run migrations to set up the database:
```python
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

4. Start the development server:
```python
python manage.py runserver
```

5. Access the API at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Database

PostgreSQL is used with the following configuration:

```python
'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'RailwayBookingSystem',
        'USER': 'postgres',
        'PASSWORD':'1234',
        'HOST':'localhost' 
    }
```

## Endpoints

### User Registration

- **URL:** `/user/register/`
- **Method:** `POST`

- `password` (string): User's password.
- **Authorization:** None

### User Logout

- **URL:** `/user/logout/`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Description:** Logout the authenticated user and delete the authentication token.
- **Authorization:** Token-based authentication required.

### Add Train

- **URL:** `/add_train/`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Description:** Add a new train with a unique train number, source, destination, and total seats.
- **Parameters:**
- `train_number` (integer): Train number (unique).
- `source` (string): Source station.
- `destination` (string): Destination station.
- `total_seats` (integer): Total number of seats on the train.
- **Authorization:** Superuser authentication required.

### Book Seat

- **URL:** `/user/book_seat/`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Description:** Book seats on a particular train.
- **Parameters:**
- `train_number` (integer): Train number.
- `user_id` (integer): User's ID.
- `seat_count` (integer): Number of seats to book.
- **Authorization:** Token-based authentication required.

### Get Seat Availability

- **URL:** `/user/get_seat_availability/`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Description:** Fetch seat availability for trains between specified source and destination.
- **Parameters:**
- `source` (string): Source station.
- `destination` (string): Destination station.
- **Authorization:** Token-based authentication required.

### Get Booking Details

- **URL:** `/user/get_booking_details/<int:id>/`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Description:** Fetch booking details for a specific user.
- **Parameters:**
- `id` (integer): User's ID.
- **Authorization:** Token-based authentication required.

## Authentication

- **Token Authentication:** Authentication is required for most endpoints using a token-based authentication system. Users must login to obtain a token, which should be included in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests.
- **CSRF Token:** CSRF tokens are required for certain endpoints to prevent CSRF attacks. Ensure that the CSRF token is included in the request headers.

## Error Handling

- Errors are returned as JSON objects with appropriate status codes and error messages.
- Common error responses include:
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request parameters.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Unauthorized access.
- `403 Forbidden`: Insufficient permissions.
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found.
- `409 Conflict`: Concurrent booking operation failed.
- Detailed error messages provide guidance on how to resolve issues.

### Note on Race Condition Handling

The `book_seat` function employs database transactions and row-level locking to address the race condition issue. Here's how it works:

```python
# In the book_seat function
try:
    with transaction.atomic():
        # Use select_for_update() to acquire a row-level lock
        train = trains.objects.select_for_update().get(train_number=train_number)

        # Critical section of code where seats are booked
        # ...

except IntegrityError:
    # Handle the case where a concurrent booking operation fails due to row-level lock
    # Return an appropriate error response indicating the failure
